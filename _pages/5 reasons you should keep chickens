Chickens are farm animals, right? 
Wrong. 
Well, right and wrong. 
Yes, chickens can be farm animals and they can be pets, very tame 
pets like a cat or dog, surprisingly for some. I have kept chickens 
in my backyard for almost 10 years and I've got to say overall, they're
an awesome pet. Here is 10 reasons why

## 1. Very little work required
The dog needs food, the dog needs water, the dog needs to go outside,
uggghh. If a chicken is a pet its going to be the same thing right? 
Nope. Keeping chickens requires very little work, just food, water,
shelter, protection and a place to scratch around (a garden would be a good 
example and hopefully the place you use for that). More on preparation later.

## 2. Eggs! 
Yes, I know, how awesome is that! Oh wait... I never even 
explained what eggs had to do with this. As you might already know, chickens
lay eggs. So by keeping chickens, you get free eggs! Also, chicken eggs that 
you didn't buy from the shop (sort of "homemade" eggs) taste much better
than the ones from the shop, regardless of whether they're free range or
cage eggs!

## 3. They get rid of snails, tics and all those nasty things
Chickens will eat almost any type of insect they can reach and the nasty ones
like tics will be gone before you can say tic.  

## 4. Children love them
I've seen kids have the best time of their lives with chickens, ranging from 
just picking them up to teaching them tricks! Chickens can be quite amusing 
at times, I've got to say (Sorry, I'm not going to spoil anything, you'll have to 
see for yourself ;) ) 

## 5. They can help save the planet! 
Seriously, I'm not gone mad (yet) 
As you (probably) know, there is a Global Warming crisis and one of the causes of 
Global Warming is food waste. Well, chickens can help you there. If you have any 
leftovers from dinner, you're chickens will be more than delighted to eat it
 (just don't give them animal meat, more on that later). Unless you're a
carnivore, chickens will eat 80% of what was going to the landfill. That 
doesn't just save the planet, it save your money too! 
All hail you're almighty feather friend! 

There probably is loads of other reasons to keep chickens but those are the 
main ones. I hope this article will help you in some way, whether you
take up chicken keeping or not! :)
